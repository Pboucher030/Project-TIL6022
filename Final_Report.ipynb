    "Over the past decade, the Netherlands has witnessed a notable increase in remote work, which has significantly altered various aspects of mobility and commuting patterns. The objective of this research is to examine the impact of remote work on mobility trends, transportation modes and their long-term implications for urban planning and environmental outcomes.\n"
